        <h1>Canvassing &amp; Organisation: Making Regular Activism Downright Easy</h1>

        <p>RISE needs to ensure that we keep track of
            interactions of voters with the organisation.</p>

        <p>To effectively fight elections, we're going to need to be equipped. We need to know who are the
            supporters of RISE â€“ our members, who has signed our petitions, who has donated to us, who
            has expressed sympathies with Scotland's Left Alliance, this is the purpose of COMRADE.</p>

        <p>There are a record 4.1 million voters in Scotland. Let's keep track of every interaction we have with
            them. Every petition signature, every donation, every purchase from the shop, every door knocked, every
            question asked, every organised leaflet drop.</p>
